<h2 class="gap3"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a><i>INTRODUCTION</i></h2>


<p>The present collection of "Representative Plays by American
Dramatists" is the first of its kind to be offered to the general
reader. In its scope, it covers a period from 1765-1911, and in its
plan of selection, it strives to show the advance in playwriting
during successive periods of American history.</p>

<p>Because of this scheme, the choice of plays for the Colonial and
Revolutionary sections necessarily includes several which, while
written for the stage, are not authentically located as far as production
is concerned. There is no indication that Robert Rogers's
"Ponteach" was ever accepted by any of the theatrical companies
of the time, and there is no positive proof that Mrs. Mercy
Warren's "The Group" was ever done, although there are casual
references to the fact that performances were given at Amboyne.
Nor have we any right to believe that Samuel Low's "The Politician
Out-witted" received other than scant treatment from the
managers to whom it was submitted; it was published rather to
please the readers of the closet drama. Nevertheless, it has been
thought essential to include these plays because they are representative
of the spirit of the times, and help to give a more comprehensive
view of the subjects which were treated in dramatic
form by the early American playwrights.</p>

<p>From the moment the American writer ceased to be an Englishman,
and became fully aware of his national consciousness,
American drama, following the trend of the development of
American literature, began to feel its way for the proper expression
of national characteristics.</p>

<p>And so, in the second and third volumes of this series, the
reader will find plays which, while not wonderful in their literary
value, are, nevertheless, very distinctive, as reflecting the theatrical
tastes of the time, and the very crude, but none the less sincere,
technical effort of the playwrights. All the dramas included
in the second and third volumes have had their stage productions,
and are thus representative of characteristics which mark the
abilities of certain actors, whose claims to originality are found in
the special types they created.</p>

<p>It has been the present editor's object so to arrange the successive
order of these plays that the reader may not only be able to
judge the change in stagecraft and technique, but, likewise, may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
note the change in social idea and in historical attitude toward
certain subjects. For example, "The Contrast" contains the first
American Stage Yankee&mdash;a model for a succession of Stage
Yankees to follow. But, whereas Royall Tyler's <i>Jonathan</i> was
not especially written to exploit the peculiar abilities of Mr.
Wignell, the comedian, most of the Yankee plays of a later date
were written to exploit the peculiar excellences of such actors as
G. H. Hill and James H. Hackett.</p>

<p>In no way can the reader better sense the change in social customs
and ideals than by reading a series of plays written in successive
generations and reflecting the varying customs of the
time. In some respects "The Contrast" may be considered our
very earliest drama of social manners, even though Royall Tyler
was not over-successful in stamping the small talk of his women
as being distinctively American. Rather is it the direct imitation&mdash;without
the brilliancy&mdash;of the small talk in "The School for
Scandal." But, nevertheless, "The Contrast" does attempt to
deal with society in New York before the nineteenth century, and
in Mrs. Mowatt's "Fashion," in Mrs. Bateman's "Self," in Bronson
Howard's "Saratoga" (which has been published), in Clyde
Fitch's "The Moth and the Flame," and in Langdon Mitchell's
"The New York Idea," we are given a very significant and
sharply defined panoramic view of the variations in moral and
social attitudes.</p>

<p>The plays included in this series have very largely been selected
because of their distinct American flavour. The majority of the
dramas deal directly with American subjects. But it seemed unwise
and unrepresentative to frame one's policy of selection too
rigidly on that score. Had such a method been adhered to, many
of the plays written for Edwin Forrest would have to be omitted
from consideration. It would have been difficult, because of this
stricture, to include representative examples of dramas by the
Philadelphia and Knickerbocker schools of playwrights. Robert
T. Conrad's "Jack Cade," John Howard Payne's "Brutus,"
George Henry Boker's "Francesca da Rimini," and Nathaniel P.
Willis's "Tortesa, the Usurer," would thus have been ruled from
the collection. Nevertheless are they representative plays by
American dramatists. Another departure from the American atmosphere
is in the case of Steele Mackaye; here in preference to
"Hazel Kirke," I have selected "Paul Kauvar," farthest away
from American life, inasmuch as it deals with Nihilism, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
written at a time when there was a Nihilistic fever in New York
City.</p>

<p>No editor, attempting such a comprehensive collection as this,
can be entirely successful in including everything which will enrich
his original plan. There are always limitations placed upon
him by the owners of copyrights, and by gaps in the development,
due to loss of manuscripts. It was naturally my desire to have all
the distinctive American playwrights represented in the present
collection. Therefore, in justice, the omissions have to be indicated
here, because they leave gaps in a development which it
would have been well to offer unbroken and complete.</p>

<p>When the collection was first conceived, there was every indication
that permission would be granted me to reproduce at least
one of the Robert Montgomery Bird manuscripts, now owned by
the University of Pennsylvania. Naturally, a collection of representative
plays should include either Bird's "The Gladiator," or
one of his other more or less oratorical and poetical pieces, written
under the inspiration of Edwin Forrest. The intention to include
John Augustus Stone's "Metamora" brought to light, after correspondence
with the Forrest Home in Philadelphia, that either the
manuscript of that play has irrevocably been destroyed, or else
has been preserved so carefully that no one remotely connected
with the actor Forrest has thus far been able to locate it.
Only a few well remembered speeches and isolated scenes are
seemingly left of a play which increased so largely the fame of
Mr. Forrest.</p>

<p>In the selection of <i>types</i> my attention naturally became centered
on the characters of <i>Colonel Mulberry Sellars</i>, and <i>Judge
Bardwell Slote</i>, the former in a dramatization of "The Gilded
Age," by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner, and the latter,
in a play by Benjamin E. Woolf, called "The Mighty Dollar."
Extended investigation revealed the fact that, even if the plays
are not lost, they are still unlocated, by the literary executors of
Mark Twain on the one hand, and by the family of Mr. Woolf on
the other. It is well to mention these instances, because, until the
recent interest in the origins of American drama, manifest on all
sides, there has been a danger that many most valuable manuscript
plays would be lost to the student forever.</p>

<p>At a revival of individual scenes from distinctive American
Plays, given in New York, on January 22, 1917, considerable
difficulty was experienced before the stock-company manuscript<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of Frank E. Murdoch's "Davy Crockett" was procured. This
play, old-fashioned in its general development, is none the less
representative of old-time melodramatic situation and romantic
manipulation, and there is every reason to believe that, with the
tremendous changes in theatrical taste, unless this play is published
in available printed form, it will be lost to the student of
ten years from now. The play would have been included in the
present edition if space had allowed.</p>

<p>When I came to a consideration of the modern section, there
were many omissions which had to be made, due very largely to
the fact that authors and owners of copyright were loath to forego
their rights. A collection of this kind should undoubtedly have
the name of James A. Herne represented in its contents, inasmuch
as none of Mr. Herne's plays have heretofore been published, and
two of his most distinctive dramas in original manuscript, "Margaret
Fleming" and "Griffith Davenport," have been totally destroyed
by fire. But representatives of Mr. Herne's family have
declined, at the present time, to allow his plays to be published.
This is to be regretted, inasmuch as nearly all of the most prominent
American playwrights are represented, either in the publication
of isolated plays or in definitive editions. I should have
liked to end this collection with the inclusion of Mr. Eugene
Walter's "The Easiest Way;" at the present time, that play,
which was once issued in an edition privately printed, is to be
found in the <i>Drama League Series</i> of plays.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of non-copyright material, two interesting
conditions have been revealed through investigation. The first
published play, in America, was "Androboros," by Governor
Robert Hunter, written in collaboration with Chief Justice Lewis
Morris.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Only one copy of that play is in existence, owned by
Mr. H. E. Huntington, of New York, having formerly been
a valued possession in the library of the Duke of Devonshire; and
having descended from the private ownership of David Garrick
and John Kemble, the English actors. Naturally, the private
collector is loath, in view of the rarity of his edition, to allow it,
at present, to be reprinted.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The title-page of "Androboros" reads: "Androboros"/ A/Bographical [<i>Sic.</i>]
Farce/In Three Acts, Viz./The Senate,/The Consistory,/and/The Apotheosis./
By Governour Hunter./Printed at Moropolis since 1st August, 1714. [Taken
from Huntington Copy. Moropolis means Fool's Town.]</p></div>

<p>Some scholars, however, point to "Les Muses de la Nouvelle-France,"
printed in Paris in 1609, where the third piece is "Le<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de Neptune en la Nouvelle-France." According to Marc
Lescarbot, this was "repr&eacute;sent&eacute;e sur les flots du Port-Royal le
quatorzi&egrave;me de Novembre, mille six cens six, au retour de Sieur
de Poutrincourt du pais des Armouchiquois." This may be
regarded as example of the first play written and acted on North
American soil, it, however, being in French, and not given within
what is now the United States, but rather at Port Royal, in
Acadia. (See two interesting letters, 1<span style="vertical-align:super;">o</span> W. J. Neidig, <i>Nation</i>,
88:86, January 28, 1909; 2<span style="vertical-align:super;">o</span> Philip Alexander Bruce, <i>Nation</i>,
88:136, February 11, 1909.)</p>

<p>It was my further desire, as an example of college playwriting,
to include the text of Barnabas Bidwell's "The Mercenary
Match," written at Yale, and played by the students of Yale.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Only one copy of that play is, thus far, known to be in existence,
owned by Mr. Evert Jansen Wendell, and its inclusion in the
present collection is debarred for the same reason.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The/Mercenary Match,/A Tragedy./By Barna Bidwell./New Haven:/Printed
by Meigs, Bowen and Dana,/In Chapel-Street./(1785.)</p></div>

<p>Were this collection&mdash;Representative Plays by American
Dramatists&mdash;encyclopedic in its scope, rather than a suggestive
arrangement of a limited number of plays for the purpose of illustrating
certain phases of playwriting in American theatrical history,
it would have been necessary for the editor to intersperse,
here and there, between the plays, certain minor forms of dramatic
writing, characteristic of the work done in this country.
For example, plays and dialogues written at colleges at a period
ante-dating 1800, and likewise ante-dating the Revolution, are a
distinctive development in themselves, and would form an interesting
contrast with the work being done at the colleges since the
beginning of the present so-called dramatic renaissance (1917).
These dialogues, in their proper place, will be dealt with in the introductions
to a few of the plays. But it is well to indicate here
that such illustrations of very definite forms of dramatic expression
have been omitted.</p>

<p>In all cases the texts used have been carefully collated with
the first editions of the published dramas and, wherever possible,
the original casts have been given with the Dramatis Person&aelig;.
Interest in American drama consists very largely in the elements
of comparison and contrast which certain definite dramas suggest.
Even if there is no manuscript of "Metamora" extant,
there is sufficient data relating to the character of <i>Metamora</i> to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
contrast the play with Robert Rogers's "Ponteach." Even
though Mrs. Warren's "The Group" might be ruled out as an
acting drama, none the less is it definitely reflective of the
revolutionary temper of Revolutionary times. A comparison of other
types of plays will be made as they occur in the course of the three
volumes. I emphasize the point here, because I wish to suggest
that such a collection as this offers infinite possibilities in the
study of the historical, social, and economic evolution of America.</p>

<p>Most of these plays have been revived. There will be noted,
later, performances of "The Prince of Parthia," of "The Contrast,"
of Dunlap's "Andr&eacute;," and of Mrs. Mowatt's "Fashion," according
to our modern methods of acting. These plays may often seem
verbose and lacking in continuous development and interest.
This would lead us to believe that possibly the early actor had
means at his disposal of overcoming these defects by a method of
dramatic technique unknown to the present player. In reading
these dramas, one must be able to bear in mind the differences
which exist between the theatre of to-day and the theatre of yesterday,
between the tradition of the actor of to-day and of the
actor of yesterday. The technique, for example, in the characterization
of <i>Jonathan</i>, and in the characterization of <i>Solon
Shingle</i>, is different from the technique which characterizes the
work of Clyde Fitch or which is to be found in David Belasco's
"Peter Grimm." In other words, in such a collection, one asks, not
the judgment of the highest literary standards, but the judgment
of an historical appreciation of the changes in dramatic taste.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>This, the first volume of "Representative Plays by American
Dramatists," contains dramas which measure the tastes and inclinations
of Colonial and Revolutionary life. In the proper understanding
of their atmosphere, it is necessary to know something
of the general spirit of the theatre of the period; to measure
the conditions, customs, and social peculiarities of the provincial
actors and audiences. For that reason, it would be well for the
general reader beforehand to obtain a bird's-eye view of the
history of the American theatre&mdash;a view which will comprise
some consideration of the first playhouse in this country, of the
conditions which confronted Hallam, Henry, and Douglass, the
first actors to be at the head of what, in Williamsburg, Virginia,
was known as the Virginia Comedians, and in New York and
Philadelphia, as the American Company.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>No more fascinating study could be imagined than following
the trials and tribulations of the actors in America at this early
day, who, as soon as they reached Philadelphia, or as soon as they
attempted to invade Boston, were confronted by the Puritanical
and sectarian prejudices, against which the early history of the
American theatre had to struggle. The personalities of the
Hallams, of Douglass and Hodgkinson, are picturesque and worth
while tracing in all aspects of their Thespian careers in the
Colonies. So, too, the persons of Thomas Wignell, the Comedian,
and of Mrs. Merry, are of especial interest. Wignell, at the John
Street Theatre, in New York, and at the Southwark Theatre, in
Philadelphia, was wont to amuse George Washington, who, on
careful examination of his Journals and expense accounts, looms
up as the one big theatre-goer of the time.</p>

<p>The reader who follows the effect open hostility with England
had upon the American theatre, will find most interesting material
relating to the dramatic activities of the soldiers under the
leadership of Generals Burgoyne and Howe. In fact, no account
of dramatic writings in this country can ignore the fact that General
Burgoyne, apart from the farce which incited Mrs. Mercy
Warren, was himself a serious dramatist, who took his work seriously,
and whose dramas may be obtained at any large reference
library. The Red-Coats, as actors, amused their Tory public
with such plays as "Tamerlane," "The Busybody," and "Zara;"
and when they invaded the Southwark Theatre, around 1777,
Major Andr&eacute;, the presiding genius of the English soldier-actors,
turned to good account his ability as a scene-painter, and painted
a backdrop which was preserved in Philadelphia until 1821, when
it was destroyed by fire. We have, however, a description of the
scene, taken from Durang's "History of the Philadelphia Stage."</p>

<p>"It was a landscape," he writes, "presenting a distant <i>champagne</i>
country, and a winding rivulet, extending from the front
of the picture to the extreme distance. In the foreground and
centre was a gentle cascade&mdash;the water exquisitely executed&mdash;overshadowed
by a group of majestic forest trees. The perspective
was excellently preserved; the foliage, verdure, and general
colouring artistically toned and glazed. It was a drop scene, and
Andr&eacute;'s name was inscribed on the back of it in large black letters."</p>

<p>The early American theatre was nothing more than the theatre
of England transplanted to a more provincial atmosphere. We
have a record of dramatic performances being given at Williams<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and Mary College before the Royal Governor, in 1702, and, in
1736, the students were presenting Addison's "Cato." In 1714,
in Massachusetts, Chief Justice Samuel Sewall, famed for his
witchcraft injunctions, protested against acting in Boston, and
warned the people in this fashion: "Let not Christian Boston goe
beyond Heathen Rome in the practice of Shameful Vanities."</p>

<p>Evidently the actors who had appeared in New York from the
West Indies, in 1702, were, by an ill wind, blown into the sharp-prejudiced
atmosphere of New England. Some authorities are
inclined to believe that Thomas Kean's appearance on March 5,
1750, in New York, when, as noted by the <i>Weekly Postboy</i>, he
gave a performance of "Richard III," with permission of Governor
Clinton, really begins the history of legitimate theatrical
performances in America. This, however, is not historically accurate,
for, in South Carolina, it is noted that the first dramatic
production occurred in 1734 or 1735, January 18th, although the
first Charleston theatre was afterwards erected in 1773, the third
regular theatre to be established in the Colonies. (See <i>The
Nation</i>, 99:278-279; Yates Snowden, "South Carolina Plays and
Playwrights," <i>The Carolinian</i>, November, 1909.)</p>

<p>The disputed point as to the first theatre in America has also
been very thoroughly discussed by Judge Charles P. Daly in his
brochure, "The First Theatre in America." (Dunlap Society,
New Series, No. 1, 1896.)</p>

<p>In 1755, the Reverend Samuel Davies, whose eloquence made
him quite as much an actor as a divine, complained of conditions
in Virginia, declaring that plays and romances were more read
than "the history of the Blessed Jesus."</p>

<p>The real narrative of Colonial acting, however, begins with
William Hallam's appearance in Williamsburg in "The Merchant
of Venice," on September 5, 1752; thereafter, as is so excellently
traced in Seilhamer, the American Theatre, with its different
itinerant companies, began to flourish.</p>

<p>The theatre was such a recreation to the Colonial people that,
in many ways, it figured as the one source of official entertainment;
especially on occasions when the Royal Governor had to
show hospitality to visiting people. For example, the <i>Maryland
Gazette</i> for November 17, 1752, declares that "The Emperor of
the Cherokee nation, with his Empress and their son, the young
Prince, attended by several of his warriors and Great Men, and
their Ladies, were received at the Palace by his Honour the Gov<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>ernor,
attended by such of the Council as were in Town on Thursday,
the 9th instant, with all the Marks of Courtesy and Friendship,
and were that Evening entertained at the Theatre with the
Play (the Tragedy of 'Othello'), and a Pantomime Performance
which gave them great surprise, as did the fighting with naked
swords on the Stage, which occasioned the Empress to order
some about her to go and prevent them killing one another."</p>

<p>The spirit of the theatre-going at this period has been excellently
suggested by John Esten Cook in his novel, "The Virginia
Comedians," but the reader who will consult rare files of Colonial
newspapers will find therein many advertisements which will
throw light on some of the social details of the theatre. It is
enough here to suggest that, in the reading of the different plays
here offered, some consideration be paid to the general theatrical
atmosphere which created and fostered them.</p>

<p>In several of the Introductions the editor has had occasion to
mention the exercises and dialogues and plays given in the colleges
before the Revolution. These were the distinctive forms
which time and occasion created; otherwise the early American
dramatist framed his pieces in imitation of English and German
tradition. However, as soon as the national period began, another
interesting dramatic experiment was put into effect. This
has been noted by W. W. Clapp, in his chapter written for Justin
Winsor's "Commemorative History of Boston." He says:</p>

<p>"[It was] the custom in the earlier days of the theatre to signalize
passing events by such appropriate notice as the resources of
the stage would permit."</p>

<p>In other words, the event called forth from the Manager, because
of commercial possibilities, certain spectacular scenes to attract
the patriotic notice of the people. Manager Hodgkinson,
on September 20, 1797, celebrated the launching of the frigate
<i>Constitution</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> On January 8, 1800, at the New York Theatre, an
"Ode on the Death of General Washington" was recited by Mr.
Hodgkinson, written by Samuel Low. It is interesting here to
note likewise that Royall Tyler pronounced a Eulogy on Washington
at Bennington, Vermont, on February 22, 1800.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Dunlap, himself atune to the hour, wrote "Yankee Chronology; or, Huzza
for the Constitution"&mdash;"a musical Interlude, in One Act, to which are added, The
Patriotic Songs of the Freedom of the Seas, and Yankee Tars," produced at the
Park Theatre, New York, 1812. Dunlap wrote many pieces of like character.</p></div>

<p>A patriotic effusion, celebrating the capture of the British
frigate <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i>, was produced on October 2, 1812. In 1813, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
commemorate the victory of Perry, a piece was mounted, entitled,
"Heroes of the Lake; or, the Glorious Tenth of September."
Another piece, equally as suggestive in its title, was
"The Sailor's Return; or, Constitution Safe in Port."</p>

<p>When the Marquis de Lafayette visited the United States in
1825, and was taken to the theatre, the occasion was celebrated
by an appropriate "drop." In other words, the Manager, even in
those days, had the commercial instinct fully developed.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the preparation of the present collection, the editor wishes
to thank those who have been generous in their advice and appreciation
of the work in hand. Being a pioneer effort, the original
research necessitated has been of an extensive character. I have
had, in order to verify my data, to correspond extensively, not
only with the members of the families of the different playwrights,
but with many historical societies and libraries. I have likewise
had the advantage of being able to consult with Dr. F. W. Atkinson,
of the Brooklyn Polytechnic, whose collection of American
Drama is probably one of the richest in the country, and
with Professor Brander Matthews, whose interest in all drama
makes the historian continually in his debt. Certain information
concerning Royall Tyler has been furnished me by members of
the Tyler family, including Mrs. E. L. Pratt, of Boston. In their
proper places, when the plays occur, certain credits and references
will be found, but it is a pleasure for me here to thank Mr. Percy
Mackaye, Mr. David Belasco, Mr. Langdon Mitchell, Mr.
Augustus Thomas, the Clyde Fitch Estate, and the Bronson Howard
Estate, for their generous co&ouml;peration in bringing the present
collection to a successful issue. The privilege is also mine to
thank Mr. L. Nelson Nichols, of the Americana Division, and
Mr. Victor H. Paltsits, in charge of the Manuscript Division, of
the New York Public Library, together with other officials of that
Library, of Columbia University, and of the Library Company of
Philadelphia, and Miss Z. K. Macdonald, for their unfailing
courtesy and untiring efforts in my behalf.</p>

<p>In order to preserve uniformity of style throughout the text of
the plays certain modifications in punctuation and spelling have
been adopted.</p>
